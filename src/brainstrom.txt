I am trying to create application go load transactions from muliple sources. For example, csv transactions from different bank, credit cards etc.
For in the csv id different but data that i need exist. 
I would like to modularize the code in such a way so that each data source can be configured separately.
Eventually, all transactions from different data sources will transorm into one format. There will be transformation That we need to od.
I should be able o configure the mapping of each data source. 
I would like to modularize the code so it's easier to add more data sources in the configure with configuration.

Task: Can you create a plan for this implementation. Do not write the code yet.
